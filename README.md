# OpenCode Configuration

This repository contains my personal OpenCode configuration files.

## Installation

To clone this repository directly into your home directory at the correct location, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jasontally/opencode-config.git ~/.config/opencode
```

This will create the `~/.config/opencode` directory and download all configuration files into it.

## Contents

- `opencode.jsonc` - Main OpenCode configuration file
- `prompts/` - Directory containing custom prompts
  - `web.txt` - Web-related prompts

## Usage

After cloning, OpenCode should automatically detect and use these configuration files when you run it from any directory.

## Customization

Feel free to modify these files to suit your needs. The main configuration is in `opencode.jsonc` and custom prompts can be added to the `prompts/` directory.
